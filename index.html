                    <h3>Interactive Slide Show Hybrid Structure Layout</h4>
                    <p>The viewer is presented with an initial scene/slide depicting 12 game genres (represented by circles) on a graph with Number of Publishers on the x-axis and Global Sales (In Millions) on the y-axis for the year 1980. It will be hard to see all of the data points in the beginning as they overlay each other because there were not that many publishers and global sales in the gaming industry was low. But as time progresses the data points become more distant from each other and easier to investigate further.<br /><br />
                        
                    The right side of the visualization has the year (representing the slide) as well as a legend so the user can verify which circles represent which genre for any given year/scene. In all there are 35 scenes, each representing the Number of Publishers in relation to Global Sales (In Millions) for each game genre for each year between 1980 and 2015. Throughout the interface the user has 4 options: run the entire slideshow without interuption, reset the slideshow to the first scene (year 1980), step forward a scene/year, and step back a scene/year.</p>

                    <h3>Application of Annotations</h3>
                    <p>For each scene the circles (representing the genres) will be placed in an (x, y) coordinate that determines how many publishers were participating in that genre and what the global sales were for that genre for a given year. When the user hovers over the buttons to step forward or backward, a tooltip pops up that informs the user that they can hover over the data points for more information pertaining to that point's figures of global sales and number of publishers.<br /><br />
                        
                    The information within these tooltips will follow the points they refer to as well as update to represent the new figures for global sales and number of publishers between years. When the user hovers over the run button, they will receive another tooltip prompting them to investigate each scene more closely after the timeline animation as specific years have annotations pointing out interesting trends or observations. The annotations themselves will circle the point of interest and display a message depicting the significance of the data point in that year.<br /><br />
                        
                    In the first scene/year (1980) the user is given an annotation informing them that the real excitement does not begin until 1992 along with the prompt to click the annotation itself to skip to the scene/year of 1992. The user will still be able to run from the first scene/year or step through if they desire. 1992 gives another annotation to help the viewer stay interested by hinting at what development is foreshadowed to come in regard to the changes of the data points for the upcoming scenes/years. Overall annotations will appear for the scenes/years of 1992, 2002, 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2015 as interesting observations and trends occur. The annotations are cleared between scenes via the user events of clicking the control buttons because their messaging would not be pertainable to the updated parameters of the data points for the next/previous scene's/year's global sales and number of publishers reported.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Parameters and State Control</h3>
                    <p>Between each scene/year the user will have a new values for each genre pertaining to the number of publishers and global sales as well as a new value for the current year that those figures apply to (bottom-right). These parameters dictate the positioning of the data points within the graph for each scene/year. Also, the circumference of the data point circles will be on a scale to reflect their monthly sales: larger circles means larges global sales, smaller circles for smaller global sales.<br /><br />
                        
                    Aside from the first and last scene, the user will have the option to run, reset, step forward, or step backward in the interface. For the first scene the user will not be able to reset because the interactive slide show is already at the beginning and the user will not be able to step back as there is obviously no data prior to 1980 to display. For the last scene the user will not be able to step forward because there is no data to display beyond 2015.</p>
                    
                    <h3>User Events and Triggers</h3>
                    <p>It will be the four clickable buttons that trigger the parameter changes for each scene/year. These parameters include the displayed year and placement of the data points via their individual values for global sales and number of publishers for that current scene/year, the information displayed in each data point's tooltip, and the presence of particular annotations for specific years where there are notable observations or trends.<br /><br />

                    I displayed the buttons above the visualization for easy access, and positioned the buttons that move the scenes/years forward in front of their corresponding counterpart that reverses their effect. I also grouped the buttons by relation, so reset and run are side-by-side and step back and step forward are side-by-side. I also presented the buttons with opacity to not distract from the visualization, but they become completely opaque upon hover. The buttons that progress the scene/years are green as humnas are trained to associate green with addition, and the buttons that go back are red as humans are trained to associate red with subtraction. When interacting with the buttons, the user events are communicated by the changes in the visualization through the update of the data point's positions, the changes of the year value, and the addition or removal of annotations between the scenes/years.
